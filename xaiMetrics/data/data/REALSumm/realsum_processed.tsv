ext	16	Jurgen Klopp will leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season . German boss has enjoyed success with club during seven-year stint . He has been linked with Manchester City , Manchester United and Arsenal . Per Mertesacker says he would like to see Klopp in the Premier League .	refresh_out.txt	Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker has tipped compatriot Jurgen Klopp to make his mark in the Barclays Premier League if he opts to continue his career in England . Klopp , 47 , announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close , prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League . Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past , is not in their sights , but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight . But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp , Mertesacker admits he can not work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia .	DUMMY	0.4545454545454545
